# Weather Forceasting App using Bagging Classifier Algorithm (Ensemble Learning) with Decision Tree Classifier as base estimator
The dataset used is a collection of historical weather data in the Leeds area, England.
This repository works on the data extracted from the Kaggle
['Weather Dataset'](https://www.kaggle.com/muthuj7/weather-dataset)

## Overview
This app is a demonstration of how data solutions like Data Analyzes and Forecast can easily be made end user friendly, such type
of apps (web apps) can be used to get an overview of the weather through several parameters that have been provided.
<br><br>For the ease of people reading it we have created the seprate file: <br>
* [App](/app.py) : as a file for cleaning datasets, preprocessing, train models, testing models, and setting URLs on web applications.<br>
* [Requirements](/requirements.txt) : contains the packages used to build web applications. <br>
* [Procfile](/procfile) :  specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup. <br>
* [visualization](/index.html) :  display the apps that have been created based on app.py <br>

## Usage Instruction 
To run the app on your local machine follow the following instruction after cloning the repo.
* run app.py on your path directory in terminal by using command <br>```py app.py```

## Deployment 
The app is deployed using the [heroku](https://heroku.com/) <br>
